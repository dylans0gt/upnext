The Official Website for Small Music Producers to get Recognized

---
This is the front-end of a web application in progress on which users can submit a link to a YouTube video of their beat as well as links to their other social 
media accounts. This information will be stored in an SQL database. An algorithm will be implemented that randomly selects which video/link appartus submitted within the last 7 days to display once a week at 12:00am.
